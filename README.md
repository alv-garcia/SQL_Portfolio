## Welcome to my personal SQL_Portfolio portfolio!
This space features a collection of database and SQL projects with a focus on data analysis and processing.

## About Me
My name is Alvaro Silveira, and I currently work as an environmental analyst, but throughout my career and studies, data analysis and business tool building have proven essential. I have developed tools for environmental data analysis, monitoring key indicators, and calculating environmental indicators.

## Projects

## [Project 1: Restaurant Orders: Analyze Customer Behavior]

This project utilizes data provided by [Maven Analytics](https://mavenanalytics.io/data-playground?order=date_added%2Cdesc&pageSize=10&search=Resta) to analyze the behavior of restaurant consumers. Through SQL queries executed in MySQL Workbench, it was possible to assess which menu items are most frequently ordered, the most popular type of cuisine, and the orders with the highest added value. Based on this analysis, it is possible to determine which dishes added to the menu attract more customers and which dishes and cuisines are not yielding results.
