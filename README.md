## Welcome to my personal SQL_Portfolio portfolio!
This space features a collection of database and SQL projects with a focus on data analysis and processing.

## About Me
My name is Alvaro Silveira, and I currently work as an environmental analyst, but throughout my career and studies, data analysis and business tool building have proven essential. I have developed tools for environmental data analysis, monitoring key indicators, and calculating environmental indicators.
